This colab file contains my attempt to segment images into two classes background and object using various methods;
1. K-Means Clustering
2. K-Nearest Neighbour
3. Nearest Neighbour
4. Bayes' Classification
5. Support Vector Machine

And for better results contrast stretching was used on some images.
